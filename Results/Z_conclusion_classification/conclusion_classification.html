            <p>FWI is calculated from FFMC, DMC, ISI, BUI and these features have a very strong correlation reaching to 9 or more so decided to go with following strategy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selected Temperature, Rain, RH, DC and FWI and month</li>
                <li>I understand standardization and some transformation like log(x+0.5) transformation is needed for FWI and DC</li>
                <li>I trained the model with standardization & transformation, with only standardization, without standardization or transformation</li>
                <li> Original features can't be accommodated because of high correlation. Since FWI is calculated from other features so including those features and excluding the FWI will only complicate the model and there will be no improvement in performance.</li>
                <li> Performed feature engineering so that I can include other features. The generated features include: FWI/FFMC, (DMC/FWi)/ISI, FWI/BUI</li>
                <li>I trained the model with these features following the same strategy i.e with and without transformation and with standardization & no transformation.</li>
                <li>All the models were scoring (f1, roc_auc) and refited based on the roc_auc_score</li>
                <li>The best performing models in terms of F1, roc_auc, precision, balanced accuracy, etc are the models with engineered features with standardization. However, the second-best model was with original features including DC and FWI without standardization and transformation.</li>
                <li>Best Accuracy= 97.959% , F1 score= 97.128%, ROC_AUC_Score= 97.22%</li>
            </ul>
