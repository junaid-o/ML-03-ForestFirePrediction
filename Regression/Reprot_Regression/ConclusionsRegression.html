<h3>Table 1: Raw Data with Multicollinearity</h3>
<ul>
<li>The SVR model performed the best with the highest R2 scores and lowest MSE values for both train and test sets.</li>
<li>The DecisionTreeReg model performed the worst with the lowest R2 scores and highest MSE values for both train and test sets.</li>
<li>The other models had similar performances with R2 scores ranging from 0.926 to 0.969 and MSE values ranging from 1.403 to 3.402 for the test set.</li>
<li>The presence of multicollinearity in the data might have affected the performances of the models.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 2: Engineered Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RandomForestReg model performed the best with the highest R2 scores and lowest MSE values for both train and test sets.</li>
<li>The DecisionTreeReg model performed the worst with the lowest R2 score for the test set.</li>
<li>The other models had moderate performances with R2 scores ranging from 0.761 to 0.946 and MSE values ranging from 2.405 to 11.086 for the test set.</li>
<li>The performances of the models improved with the introduction of engineered features compared to the raw data with multicollinearity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 3: Raw Data and Engineered Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RandomForestReg model performed the best with the highest R2 scores and lowest MSE values for both train and test sets.</li>
<li>The DecisionTreeReg model performed the worst with the lowest R2 score for the test set.</li>
<li>The other models had moderate performances with R2 scores ranging from 0.892 to 0.955 and MSE values ranging from 2.465 to 5.349 for the test set.</li>
<li>The performance of the models improved with the addition of raw data features, but not as much as when engineered features were introduced.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table 4: Engineered Features without Rain and Wind Speed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RandomForestReg model performed the best with the highest R2 scores and lowest MSE values for both train and test sets.</li>
<li>The DecisionTreeReg model performed the worst with the lowest R2 score for the test set.</li>
<li>The other models had moderate performances with R2 scores ranging from 0.760 to 0.946 and MSE values ranging from 2.278 to 11.139 for the test set.</li>
<li>The performance of the models were similar to that of Table 2, where all engineered features were included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RandomForestReg model performed the best in all four tables, indicating that it is the most suitable model for this dataset.</li>
<li>The performances of the other models were relatively similar in all tables, with some variations depending on the type of data and features used.</li>
<li>The presence of multicollinearity in the raw data affected the performances of some models.</li>
<li>The introduction of engineered features improved the performances of the models significantly.</li>
<li>Removing certain features, such as rain and wind speed, did not significantly affect the performance of the models.</li>
</ul>
